# RetroN5 File Converter

Converts your RetroN5 save files to and from raw save files and vice versa. Built for Windows. Uses a drag & drop interface for quick and easy use when dragging your save files in from an SD card and out to your PC's emulator or storage.

## Special Thanks

This program is based on another program written by Wolf on the Retro5 Unofficial Community Forum ([Link](https://www.retro5.net/viewtopic.php?t=257)). I made a complete overhaul to the program to make it more user friendly with the drag & drop feature. I keep credit for Wolf in the program because I think Wolf deserves it.
