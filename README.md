# RetroN5 File Converter

Converts your RetroN5 save files to and from raw save files and vice versa. Built for Windows. Uses a drag & drop interface for quick and easy use when dragging your save files in from an SD card and out to your PC's emulator or storage.

## Special Thanks

This program is based on another program written by Wolf on the [Retro5 Unofficial Community Forum](https://www.retro5.net/viewtopic.php?t=257). I made a complete overhaul to the program to make it more user friendly and add new features. I kept credit to Wolf in the program because I think Wolf deserves it.
